Use UPER method to solve problems.

- U: Understand:

  - Look at examples
  - Know what the constraints of the problem are
  - Know what the expected input/output is when running the code
  - Ask any remaining questions that aren't clear in the problem.

- P: Plan:
  Develop a strategy -->

  - pseudocode the problem
  - plan first pass solution
    - brute force/naive solution
    - don't worry about space and time complexity on the first pass solution.
  - comment out your code!

- E: Execute:

  - Flush out the code!
  - Run tests on first pass solution

- R: Reflect:
  - Make sure you have run enough tests to pass
  - What is the runtime? Can you refactor your code to enhance the space and time complexity?
  - Can you implement better helper functions? Built in methods?
  - Did you write sensible variable names?
  - Is your code 'DRY'(don't repeat yourself)?
  - Spellcheck
